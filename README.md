[![Compile, format, lint & test](https://github.com/timKraeuter/FEM-Last-Algorithm-Course-You-Need-Rust/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/timKraeuter/FEM-Last-Algorithm-Course-You-Need-Rust/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

The last algorithm course you need from [FEM](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) but implemented using **Rust**. Currently, we have not implemented the course data structures since those are notoriously hard if not impossible using safe Rust.
Slides for the course are available [here](https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-algos).

The solutions are in the [`solutions`](./src/solutions) dir while the [`problems`](./src/problems) dir contains the problems without implementation.

Rust allows for unique solutions for some problems due to its unique capabilities (see, for example, [comparing binary trees](./src/solutions/compare_binary_trees.rs)).
